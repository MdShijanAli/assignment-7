        <h1 class="text-center pt-5">Differences between local storage and session storage</h1>


        <div class="container py-5">
            <h3>Local storage</h3>
            <p>localStorage is a property that allows JavaScript sites and apps to save key-value pairs in a web
                browser with no expiration date. This means the data stored in the browser will persist even after
                the browser window is closed.</p>


            <h3>Session storage</h3>
            <p>Session storage is a popular choice when it comes to storing data on a browser. It enables developers
                to save and retrieve different values. Unlike local storage, session storage only keeps data for a
                particular session. The data is cleared once the user closes the browser window.</p>
        </div>

    <div class="bg-success">
        <h1 class="text-center pt-5">Difference between Global scope and block scope</h1>


        <div class="container py-5">
            <h3>Global scope</h3>
            <p>The Javascript global scope is the context where everything in a Javascript program executes by default.
                This scope includes all variables, objects, and references that are not contained within a customized
                scope defined by a programmer. Global scope is the entire Javascript execution environment.</p>


            <h3>Block Scope</h3>
            <p>Session storage is a popular choice when it comes to storing data on a browser. It enables developers
                to save and retrieve different values. Unlike local storage, session storage only keeps data for a
                particular session. The data is cleared once the user closes the browser windowBlock Level Scope: This
                scope restricts the variable that is declared inside a specific block, from access by the outside of the
                block. The let & const keyword facilitates the variables to be block scoped.</p>

        <h1 class="text-center pt-5">How event loop work on javascript?</h1>


        <div class="container py-5">

            <p>The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack
                is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack,
                which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop</p>

        <h1 class="text-center pt-5">How can we get undefined in javascript?</h1>


        <div class="container py-5">

            <p>A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined . A method or statement also returns
                undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A function returns
                undefined if a value was not returned </p>
